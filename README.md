## Note
> I was not paid for one and a half months of work. As a result, I now retain ownership of the codebase and have made it open-source under the MIT License. This means anyone is free to use the code. <br/>
I also have the front-end code, which is built with Next.js. If anyone is interested in obtaining the front-end code, please feel free to contact me, and I will provide it as well.
